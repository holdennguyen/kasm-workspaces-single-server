## ü•∑ Usage
I use this solution to `keep my identity private` and my workstation `safe from malware`. It is incredibly more powerful than **Incognito Mode**, **VM**, and **VPN**:
- The session is pristine with `no browser history or cookies` from my host computer or previous sessions.
- Any website I visit `only runs in the context of this session`. None of the website‚Äôs code runs on my personal computer ‚Äî only the remote browser `in the disposable container`.
- The session is running the `full edition of Chrome/Brave/Firefox or even Tor` so I can add my favorite extensions and I can be confident most websites will work.
- Websites will see the IP of my Linode server and `not my home or work IP`.
- At any time I can `destroy this session` and `start a fresh one` over again.

*Researchers*, *hackers*, *Darkweb tourists*.. This solution maybe work for you!

## üíΩ About The Kasm Workspaces
**The Container Streaming Platform¬Æ**
Streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users. The Workspaces platform provides enterprise-class orchestration, data loss prevention, and web streaming technology to enable the delivery of containerized workloads to your browser.

## üîé Pros & Cons

This instruction requires knowledge of networking essentials, Linux, and Terraform. You also have to turn it off after using and re-config when turn-on (But don't worry, only three commands)

    | Solution                              | Resource             | Cost                    |
    | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------| ----------------------- |
    | Kasm Cloud Personal Browser           | 1 Core, 2GB RAM      | `$5/month fix.`         |
    | Terraform + Linode (Self Manage)      | 2 Core, 4GB RAM      | `$0.28/hour On-demand.` |

## üî± Instruction

### Setup Linode Cloud (Akamai)

You must have `a Linode Cloud account`. If you don't have an account yet, [register via my referral](https://linode.gvw92c.net/c/3922399/903680/10906) to get a `$100 credit` (expires after 4 months). 

![Credit](/docs/images/credit.png)

**Since you have a Linode account, get API Tokens to allow Terraform provision as Code:**
1. To generate a **new personal access token**, navigate to your profile by clicking on `your username` and selecting `API Tokens`.
![token1](/docs/images/token1.jpg) 
1. Click `Create a Personal Access Token`. A panel appears that allows you to give this token a label and choose the access rights you want users authenticated with the new token to have.
<img src="/docs/images/token2.jpg" alt="Logo" height="350">
1. When you have finished, click `Create Token` to generate a new `Personal Access Token`. `Copy the token and save it` to a secure location before closing the popup. **You will not be able to view this token through the Cloud Manager after closing the popup.**

### Install Terraform

[How to Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

>üîî In Windows, make sure that you add the path of the Terraform CLI executable to your PATH environment variable so that you can run from any directory on your laptop/computer.

Clone this repository, go to folder `kasm-workspaces-single-server/` and open file `main.tf` to replace **[YOUR TOKEN]** with your Personal Access Token from Linode in the previous section:

```
provider "linode" {
  token = "[YOUR TOKEN]"
}
```

Replace **[YOUR PASSWORD]** with your root user password of Linode Instance, it requires passwords to meet the following criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one number
- Contains at least one special character

```
resource "linode_instance" "kasm" {
  label = "kasm"
  type = "g6-standard-2"
  region = "us-east"
  image = "linode/ubuntu20.04"
  root_pass = "[YOUR PASSWORD]"
  backups_enabled = false
  private_ip = true
  tags = ["kasm"]
  stackscript_id = linode_stackscript.kasm-stackscript.id
}
```

Save the file and run these commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Your output will be similar:
![output](/docs/images/output.png)

`public_ip` will be your public IP address of the Linode cloud server.

After Terraform is completed, wait 10-15 minutes for `Kasm Workspaces` installation finished.

## üì∫ Kasm Workspaces
Open your browser, enter `https://[YOUR LINODE PUBLIC IP]`
![kasm workspaces1](/docs/images/kasm-workspaces.png)

Click `Advanced` and `Proceed to [YOUR LINODE PUBLIC IP] (unsafe)` (Don't worry, this is your own cloud server). Login with `admin@kasm.local`:`password`
![kasm workspaces login](/docs/images/kasm-workspaces-login.png)

We will need to SSH remotely to this server to reset the Kasm Workspace password. 
Run this command:

```
ssh root@[YOUR LINODE PUBLIC IP]
```

![SSH](/docs/images/ssh.png)

Type `yes` and **[YOUR PASSWORD]** (which you provide in `main.tf`)

![SSH Success](/docs/images/ssh-success.png)

Copy and paste this command:

```
sudo docker exec -i kasm_db psql -U kasmapp -d kasm <<EOF
    update users set
    pw_hash = 'fe519184b60a4ef9b93664a831502578499554338fd4500926996ca78fc7f522',
    salt = '83d0947a-bf55-4bec-893b-63aed487a05e',
    secret=NULL, set_two_factor=False, locked=False,
    disabled=False, failed_pw_attempts = 0 where username ='admin@kasm.local';
\q
EOF
```

After runing, it will output `UPDATE 1` which means you success to reset the password of Kasm Workspaces. Your admin account will be `admin@kasm.local`: `password`.

>If you install manual Kasm Workspaces instead of using Terraform, your random password will be output on the terminal so you don't need to do this reset task.

Now your `Kasm Workspaces` is ready:
![kasm workspaces ready](/docs/images/kasm-workspaces-ready.png)

Select the tab `WORKSPACES` on the top bar to start using.
![workspaces](/docs/images/workspaces.png)


## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Destroy Kasm Workspaces
In your terraform working directory, run this command:

```
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```
Your Linode server on the cloud will be destroyed completely!

#### Further
- You can also share an account user with your friend to use your Kasm Workspaces by config in the section `Users` (Our capacity is quite low, so multiple users is not recommended):
<img src="/docs/images/user.png" alt="Logo" height="250">

- To add more types of containers (Workspace) in your Kasm Workspaces, go to the section `Workspaces` to `Add Workspace` and config the DockerHub image. (You can build your custom Docker image and use it in Kasm Workspaces).

- If you see the error when starting some container (workspace) like `Terminal`, it is due to your server's capacity can't handle it. You can change the capacity of the Linode server by modifying it in `main.tf`.
This tutorial will use for browsing the web so I will not go into detail on this capacity issue.

- For more information, you can read Kasm Documentation [here](https://www.kasmweb.com/docs/latest/index.html).
